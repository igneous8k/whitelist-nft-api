GET "/generate"
-Returns the merkletree root. This route creates the merkletree from addresses.json and stores it in server memory (not storage to prevent access). Use this only once when you are done adding addresses in whitelist.

GET "/getproof/walletaddress"
-Returns Wallet's Merkleproof if it valid and whitelisted address with status true flag, returns status false and error true flag if address is not whitelisted.

GET "/getroot"
-Returns the Merkletree root that is already generated by /generate. This route only returns the already generated merkletree's roothash if it exists, otherwise it returns status false and error tue. Use this api to get root anytime given the the root is generated by /generate and server is not restarted.

NOTE: Merkletree is kept in Server's Memory not storage so server restarts will trigger a reset and initialize null true (Meaning nothing).
